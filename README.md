## Key Points

1. **Fee Anatomy** — The 2-3% processing fee is three layers; only the processor markup (~0.25-0.60%) is splittable
2. **Integration Spectrum** — Five levels from basic gateway (L1) to full PayFac (L5)
3. **Revenue Reality** — "75% of 2-3%" typically means $2-4 per $1,000, not $15-22
